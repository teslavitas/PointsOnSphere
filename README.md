# PointsOnSphere
Unity project that simulates equally distributed points on a spherical surface.
# Simulation principle
The idea is to solve a problem of equal distribution of N points on a shere using physical simulation.
Each point is represented by an electrically charged ball. Each ball has the same charge and mass so they push each other. All balls are enclosed in a shpere that limits their movements.
# Example 
Compiled example is published here: [https://teslavitas.github.io/PointsOnSphere/](https://teslavitas.github.io/PointsOnSphere/) 
Rotate the camera using arrow keys. Zoom with "\[" and "\]".
Press the "Add object" button to add a new ball.
